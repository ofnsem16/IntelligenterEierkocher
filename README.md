# IntelligenterEierkocher
The aim of our project is to plan an intelligent egg cooker that takes into account the size of the
egg and certain environmental factors in the cooking time, and to realise a partial construction of
this. The three subject areas of our project are divided into mechanics and construction, electrical
engineering and computer science, each of which is assigned to a diploma student as a main task.
The tasks in the part of construction and mechanics consist in planning and constructing the
housing of the egg cooker, in making different calculations and simulations and in taking over the
supervision of the production of the housing.
The tasks in the electrical engineering part consist of planning the electrical implementation of the
functions, selecting and procuring components and carrying out a price calculation.
The tasks in the computer science part consist of programming a user-friendly graphical interface for
the microcontroller and integrating the planned functions if the egg cooker is finished. Furthermore,
this part deals with the conceptual design of the construction and the creation of the logo.
